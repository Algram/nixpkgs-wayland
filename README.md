# nix-overlay-sway

This is a `nixpkgs` overlay containing:
 - `wlroots`
 - `sway-beta`
 - `wlstream`
 - `grim`
 - `slurp`
 - `waybar`
 - `redshift-wayland` (`redshift` (with `minus7` patches))

Note: This is meant to be used with a nixpkgs near `nixos-unstable`.
Except at the onset of this repo in which case it needs slightly newer,
but that should be very temporary.
